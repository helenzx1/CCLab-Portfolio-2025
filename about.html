    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I’m studying Design and Technology at Parsons, focusing on interaction
      design, creative tech, and making ideas real through prototyping.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I love creating things—digital art, small interactive pieces, and anything
      that mixes visuals with technology. I enjoy exploring new tools and
      experimenting with different aesthetics.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I’m interested in UX and interaction design roles, especially places that
      value experimentation and thoughtful digital experiences. I also plan to
      apply to top design graduate programs in the U.S.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflections on Technology & Coding</h2>
    <p>
      Technology and programming help me connect ideas with real experiences.
      I’m curious about how people interact with digital systems and how design
      can make those interactions more human, emotional, and meaningful.
