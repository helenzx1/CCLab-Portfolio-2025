  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
During the process, I realized how important it was to keep the trash elements and the whole scene visually consistent and connected. 
    I had to think about how each piece fit into the environment, including its shape, color, and placement, so the scene felt cohesive rather than scattered. 
    This made me pay more attention to the overall atmosphere and how every element contributes to the final composition.
